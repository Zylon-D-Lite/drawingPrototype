# drawingPrototype
This is command line program that turns an image into a series of commands to feed into an arduino controlled robot. The goal here is to turn any image into convincing drawing.

## Dependencies
Uses libpng for reading Images.
## Contribution
Since this is for a project show, I will not be accepting any contribution, at least before the show ends in june. You are, however, free to download and use the code but I doubt it will be of any use.

## **NOTE**
This code sucks! It's rushed, it's lacking essential features and it probably sends out periodic shocks to cpu for all I know. But it's *my* code and it will get better. And that's all that matters.
